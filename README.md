# HAR
In the analysis file, I downloaded the dataset and I do some transforms. 
- Combining the files: X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, subject_train, and subject_test
- Using the dplyr to extract the enssential variables
- Using the file label_activities.txt to label the activites.
- Using the file features.txt to rename variables in a descriptive way.
